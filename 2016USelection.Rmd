---The most recent 2016 US presidential election attracted considerable attention due to perceived populism. Monetary contributions and spending from individuals and corporations toward the campaigns of the two main candidates Mrs. Clinton & Mr. Trump were significant, in that amounts raised were spent to elect of oppose one of the candidates. 
The Federal Election Commission or FEC is tasked with administering and enforcing federal campaign finance laws as well as providing guidance to individuals or groups that are active in elections.
This project analyses contributions and spending amounts from the two above-mentioned candidates based on the FEC reporting period of January 1, 2015 thru April 29, 2016. Since fundraising plays a major role in elections, the problem I wanted to solve here is the identification of donors, their party affiliations, and their geographical locations across the country. This project has broad appeal. A typical client for this analysis would be a potential presidential candidate or any candidate for local or state office.This analysis would help those candidates better focus thier fundraising efforts. Another potential client would be the financial industry. This analysis could help that sector market his products such as wealth management towards those donors and their locations. Data to be used in this analysis will be primarily derived from the FEC website at: https://beta.gov.data The specific for data wrangling will be derived from: https://beta.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml for the year 2015-2016. My approach to solving this problem would consist of R Markdown first, followed by data wrangling with the Dplyr package. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
